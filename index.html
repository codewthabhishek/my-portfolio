<p>Hello! My name is Abhishek singh. I am  from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where I live with my family. I recently completed my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Aliganj, 
    Lucknow, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree from Shri Ramswaroop Memorial University.

    I have a passion for sports, particularly cricket, basketball, and volleyball. These activities not only keep me physically fit but also teach me valuable lessons in teamwork and discipline. 
    In addition to my love for sports, I am very enthusiastic about learning new languages and technologies. So far, I have acquired proficiency in Html, and I am currently delving into CSS, JS, and Mern for web development.
    
    My curiosity and eagerness to expand my knowledge in the IT sector drive me to constantly seek out new learning opportunities. I enjoy the challenge of mastering new skills and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in technology.
    
    In my free time, I also like to explore other interests such as reading tech blogs, participating in online coding competitions, 
    and contributing to open-source projects. My goal is to build a strong foundation in computer science and eventually work on innovative projects that make a significant impact in the tech industry.
    
    I believe that continuous learning and adaptability are key to success in the ever-evolving field of technology,
     and I am committed to honing my skills and knowledge to become a proficient and versatile IT professional.</p>.
